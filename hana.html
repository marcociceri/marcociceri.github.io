  <p>
  Dutch artist and composer Andert Tysma emerged onto the scene with his debut album, 'Children Of Trinoom,' on Apollo/R&S Records in 2022. The seasoned musician toured the world with other artists, before fully focusing on his own music.
  Tysma is now set to release his second full-length album with Apollo Records, 'Hana'. This album features seven dramatic and otherworldly pieces, reflecting his continued exploration of minimalism and his deft use of piano, strings, percussive elements, and harmonic rhythms. 'Hana' is not just an album; it is a profound journey through space and time, exploring themes of transition and the fluidity of gender within music. It is a deeply personal work that pays homage to the music that has subconsciously inspired him over the last years. The album was partly recorded in Nils Frahm's studio at the legendary Funkhaus, with strings performed by members of the Berlin Philharmonic, adding to the album’s rich and textured sound.
  For his new live show, he is collaborating with Marco Ciceri, an Italian Berlin-based visual artist renowned for his work with Alessandro Cortini and Grand River. Together, they will create a compelling live A/V show that promises to be a visual and auditory feast.
  Tysma’s dedication to his craft continues to make him a significant figure in modern composition, and his work on 'Hana' is a testament to his evolving artistry.
