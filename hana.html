  Dutch artist and composer Andert Tysma emerged onto the scene with his debut album, 'Children Of Trinoom,' on Apollo/R&S Records in 2022. The seasoned musician toured the world with other artists, before fully focusing on his own music.
  Tysma is now set to release his second full-length album with Apollo Records, 'Hana'. This album features seven dramatic and otherworldly pieces, reflecting his continued exploration of minimalism and his deft use of piano, strings, percussive elements, and harmonic rhythms. 'Hana' is not just an album; it is a profound journey through space and time, exploring themes of transition and the fluidity of gender within music. It is a deeply personal work that pays homage to the music that has subconsciously inspired him over the last years. The album was partly recorded in Nils Frahm's studio at the legendary Funkhaus, with strings performed by members of the Berlin Philharmonic, adding to the album’s rich and textured sound.
  For his new live show, he is collaborating with Marco Ciceri, an Italian Berlin-based visual artist renowned for his work with Alessandro Cortini and Grand River. Together, they will create a compelling live A/V show that promises to be a visual and auditory feast.
  Tysma’s dedication to his craft continues to make him a significant figure in modern composition, and his work on 'Hana' is a testament to his evolving artistry.

  <p>
  Marco Ciceri is a Berlin-based Italian media artist. He studied at the Faculty of Design and Art at the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano, in which his thesis, “Reality”, he created an installation that exposed the ever more present difference between live and mediated reality.<br>
  In 2014 Ciceri worked with London-based studio Marshmallow Laser Feast on an installation commissioned by the Lisbon Architecture Biennale. In 2015 he moved to Berlin to become part of the motion graphics studio Pfadfinderei. With them, Ciceri worked on live shows for various musicians such as Moderat, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Recondite. He also participated in the creation of visual installations at venues and festivals, including Berghain, Melt, MIT Boston, Funkhause, Primavera Sound, Sonar, ADE and Martin-Gropius-Bau. In his career, he also held workshops about visual music at the Goethe Institut Indonesia in Jakarta and at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar.<br>
  Since 2016 he has had a tight partnership with the musician Grand River, with whom he created audio-video shows and performances where light music and videos intertwine in a unique experience. They have performed at various venues such as Triennale Museum in Milan, Barbican Center in London, and Teatro de la Laboral in Gijon. While working with studios Ciceri also worked independently participating with installations and live performances in several international events and venues including Terraforma, Nextones, and Berliner Philharmoniker. In 2020 he started a new collaboration with musician Alessandro Cortini working on video clips at first and then developing the visual content for the improvised live performance Nati Infiniti.<br>
  In his works, Ciceri mixes different media and techniques to achieve richness in the details and what he calls a “flowing esthetic”. For his animations, he often uses automated movements created with generative software or physical motorized gears.
