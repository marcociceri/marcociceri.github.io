    <p>In 2022, Sonar Lisboa saw the debut of Alessandro Cortini’s “Nati Infiniti.” This was his first foray into installation work: An immersive audio installation spread over the four floors of Museu de Lisboa’s “Fábrica de Moagem” [The Moagem building], an old flour factory with intact antique machinery. The installation featured architectural lighting that responded to the sounds he created centered around ‘Strega,’ the instrument Cortini co-designed with Make Noise, with each floor evoking a distinct state, with the entire installation being seen in its eternity from the top floor. “Nati Infiniti” was created in an infinite nonlinear fashion and constantly evolved over carefully selected parameters.</p>
    <p>At 2023’s Berlin Atonal, Cortini debut with Marco Ciceri with a live improvisational version of “Nati Infiniti”. He reimagines this piece into a unique, evolving dialogue with the visual show. This concept highlights the interconnectedness of all things and invites us to embrace our own transformative power. Utilizing the infinite life of minerals reveals a world where they constantly morph, evolve, and transform. They are not just physical objects but embody the universe's boundless potential.</p>

  The visuals of Nati Infiniti are generated live by filming minerals moving on motors. Provided with local logistic support the show can be side-specific. The minerals could be either collected from a local site or selected from the archive at a local natural history museum.

  <p>
    Alessandro Cortini is an Italian musician, producer, composer, and instrument builder. <br>
    Cortini is one of the foremost figures of contemporary electronic music, best known for his haunting, atmospheric work. Alongside being a longstanding member of Nine Inch Nails, he is highly prolific and has released a steady stream of his own heady music on luminary labels including Mute and Important Records for the past decade. Balancing dark ambience with smokey, pulsing rhythms, his compositions are perfectly restrained, textured and mesmeric. <br>
    Cortini was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020 through his work with Nine Inch Nails, making history as the only Italian musician to have ever been honored with this recognition. Throughout his shadowy rise to fame, he has collaborated with the likes of Lawrence English, Daniel Avery and Merzbow (to name a few).<br>
    In 2021, in collaboration with boutique synth builders Make Noise, Cortini released his own, custom-designed, semi-modular synth, “Strega.” In 2022, he exhibited a high-concept audio installation called “Nati Infiniti” for Sonar 2022 at Museu de Lisboa’s “Fábrica de Moagem." Strega is the basis/grammar used to create Nati Infiniti’s sonic content.

  <p>
   Marco Ciceri is a Berlin-based Italian media artist. He studied at the Faculty of Design and Art at the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano, in which his thesis, “Reality”, he created an installation that exposed the ever more present difference between live and mediated reality.<br>
  In 2014 Ciceri worked with London-based studio Marshmallow Laser Feast on an installation commissioned by the Lisbon Architecture Biennale. In 2015 he moved to Berlin to become part of the motion graphics studio Pfadfinderei. With them, Ciceri worked on live shows for various musicians such as Moderat, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Recondite. He also participated in the creation of visual installations at venues and festivals, including Berghain, Melt, MIT Boston, Funkhause, Primavera Sound, Sonar, ADE and Martin-Gropius-Bau. In his career, he also held workshops about visual music at the Goethe Institut Indonesia in Jakarta and at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar.<br>
  Since 2016 he has had a tight partnership with the musician Grand River, with whom he created audio-video shows and performances where light music and videos intertwine in a unique experience. They have performed at various venues such as Triennale Museum in Milan, Barbican Center in London, and Teatro de la Laboral in Gijon. While working with studios Ciceri also worked independently participating with installations and live performances in several international events and venues including Terraforma, Nextones, and Berliner Philharmoniker. In 2020 he started a new collaboration with musician Alessandro Cortini working on video clips at first and then developing the visual content for the improvised live performance Nati Infiniti.<br>
  In his works, Ciceri mixes different media and techniques to achieve richness in the details and what he calls a “flowing esthetic”. For his animations, he often uses automated movements created with generative software or physical motorized gears.
