    <p>In 2022, Sonar Lisboa saw the debut of Alessandro Cortini’s “Nati Infiniti.” This was his first foray into installation work: An immersive audio installation spread over the four floors of Museu de Lisboa’s “Fábrica de Moagem” [The Moagem Building], an old flour factory with intact antique machinery. The installation featured architectural lighting that responded to the sounds he created centered around ‘Strega,’ the instrument Cortini co-designed with Make Noise, with each floor evoking a distinct state, 
      with the entire installation being seen in its eternity from the top floor. “Nati Infiniti” was created in an infinite nonlinear fashion and constantly evolved over carefully selected parameters.</p>
    <p>For 2023’s Berlin Atonal, Cortini debuted his live improvisational version of “Nati Infiniti.” He reimagines this piece into a unique, evolving dialogue via an audio-visual show designed together with, and by, Marco Ciceri. This concept highlights the interconnectedness of all things and invites us to embrace our own transformative power. Utilizing the infinite life of minerals reveals a world where they constantly grow, evolve, and interact. They are not just physical objects but embody the universe's boundless potential. Nati Infiniti has been performed across a series of 
      sold-out performances world-wide - each showcasing an improvised version of Nati Infiniti with no two concerts ever the same.</p>

  The visuals of Nati Infiniti are generated live by filming minerals moving on motors. Provided with local logistic support the show can be site-specific. The minerals could be either collected from a local site or selected from the archive at a local natural history museum.

  <p>
    Alessandro Cortini is an Italian musician, producer, composer, and instrument builder.
Cortini is one of the foremost figures of contemporary electronic music, best known for his haunting, atmospheric work. Alongside being a longstanding member of Nine Inch Nails, he is highly prolific and has released a steady stream of his own heady music on luminary labels including Mute, Hospital, and Important Records for the past decade. Throughout his shadowy rise to fame, he has collaborated with the likes of Lawrence English, Daniel Avery and Merzbow (to name a few). Balancing dark ambience with smokey, pulsing rhythms, his compositions are perfectly restrained, textured and mesmeric.
Cortini was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020 through his work with Nine Inch Nails, making history as the only Italian musician to have ever been honored with this recognition.
In 2021, in collaboration with boutique synth builders Make Noise, Cortini released his own, custom-designed, semi-modular synth, “Strega” (Italian for ‘witch’). That same year, he used Strega to build his latest full length, Scuro Chiaro [Mute], which Pitchfork described as “pitched somewhere between purgatory and the planetarium ... consistently managing to thrill and surprise”. 
In addition to years of extensive worldwide touring, Cortini has also soundtracked fashion shows including Alexander McQueen, Dior, and several of Fendi’s presentations. In 2022, he exhibited a high-concept audio installation called “Nati Infiniti” for Sonar 2022 at Museu de Lisboa’s “Fábrica de Moagem.” A live version of “Nati Infiniti” is set to debut at Berlin Atonal in 2023.
Alessandro Cortini’s music has been licensed for use in television, film and documentaries, games, and commercials, including FX’s hit show The Bear, “Thank You Very Much” a documentary about Andy Kaufman, Samsung, BMW, Sony, and Netflix. Remixes have also been a part of Cortini’s identity – remixing the likes of Depeche Mode to Mogwai to Death Cab For Cutie, Yann Tiersen to Vatican Shadow, and more between and beyond.
