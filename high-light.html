    <p>"High Light" expresses the interplay of time and light. At its core, the installation showcases a dialogue between two distinct sources of illumination: the timeless flicker of a candle and its replication in the contemporary glow of an LED sculpture.</p>

    <p>Watching a flame has long been a common meditative experience - in this piece, the viewer is invited to use that practice to reflect on the contrast and harmony of these two disparate light sources. As the candle flickers and diminishes in brightness, its digital counterpart follows, echoing the rhythmic cadence of the fire's illumination.</p>

    <p>The technological dissonance between the candle and the LED sculpture prompts reflection on the evolution of human innovation and its relationship to ancient traditions. While through their coexistence within the installation, the passage of time becomes perceivable, as observers witness the gradual transformation of light from both the natural flame and the artificial LED.</p>

    <p>In essence, "High Light" serves as a visual meditation on the enduring presence of light across time and technologies, bridging the gap between past and present while allowing the viewer to immerse themselves in a reverie of contrasts and connections.</p>
