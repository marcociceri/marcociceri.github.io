    <p>“Extinction” is a video installation that traces the major catastrophes of our planet that have caused the end of many living species. Through this path, we want to put into perspective the current state of the planet and the loss of several living species that are also occurring due to human intervention.
    In the piece, we find uncertainties, transitions, harmonies, and contrast between elements that are all presented with images and sounds that merge into waves of varied intensity, ephemeral pauses, rhythmic accelerations, dramatic cadences and euphoric moments.</p>

    <p>Both video and audio elements act like the flux of nature that erupts and destroys, followed by a period of calmness in order to culminate into another moment of change. The state of constant change is shaped by artificial technologies that are sometimes supporting and sometimes contrasting. Every catastrophe, natural or man-made, is followed by a phase of healing because nature has a way of recovering from damage, no matter how long it takes.</p>

    <p>"Extinction" is a display of ecology brought to its extreme. It is a reminder of our power and powerlessness. We may not want to take on the responsibility of shaping our environment nor the restriction of being shaped by it, but there is no way out of the obligations of nature because we are nature ourselves.</p>

    Besides her studio albums, Portioli has created original sound art installations for Rome’s La Galleria Nazionale and Milan’s Il Pianeta, a project of Terraforma Festival. She also contributed her interpretation of a meditation piece for the Soundworks app together with MUTEK, collaborated with Ableton for the creation of Live 11 and Ableton Loop and created and performed her piece “Tuning the Wind” in 4D spatial sound on several occasions.<br>
    Portioli has performed as Grand River at major international venues and festivals, including CTM Festival, NODE Festival, Berghain, MUTEK, Mapping Festival, Kraftwerk, Barbican Hall, Funkhaus, Maintenant Festival, Le Guess Who?, The Labyrinth, WOS Festival, and many more. She was selected to take part in SHAPE Platform’s 2021 programme.<br>
    She collaborates with visual artist Marco Ciceri on special A/V performances, as well as on the visuals for One Instrument, the record label she founded that invites artists to respond to a unique creative brief – to create a piece of music using just one instrument.<br>
    Aimée Portioli holds a bachelor’s degree from the Faculty of Linguistics and Communication of Milan. Her thesis explored the psychology of the communicative function of music in media. Her work today is motivated by similar questions of sound and music as a form of communication that goes beyond language.<br>

   Marco Ciceri is a Berlin-based Italian media artist. He studied at the Faculty of Design and Art at the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano, in which his thesis, “Reality”, he created an installation that exposed the ever more present difference between live and mediated reality.<br>
  In 2014 Ciceri worked with London-based studio Marshmallow Laser Feast on an installation commissioned by the Lisbon Architecture Biennale. In 2015 he moved to Berlin to become part of the motion graphics studio Pfadfinderei. With them, Ciceri worked on live shows for various musicians such as Moderat, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Recondite. He also participated in the creation of visual installations at venues and festivals, including Berghain, Melt, MIT Boston, Funkhause, Primavera Sound, Sonar, ADE and Martin-Gropius-Bau. In his career, he also held workshops about visual music at the Goethe Institut Indonesia in Jakarta and at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar.<br>
  Since 2016 he has had a tight partnership with the musician Grand River, with whom he created audio-video shows and performances where light music and videos intertwine in a unique experience. They have performed at various venues such as Triennale Museum in Milan, Barbican Center in London, and Teatro de la Laboral in Gijon. While working with studios Ciceri also worked independently participating with installations and live performances in several international events and venues including Terraforma, Nextones, and Berliner Philharmoniker. In 2020 he started a new collaboration with musician Alessandro Cortini working on video clips at first and then developing the visual content for the improvised live performance Nati Infiniti.<br>
  In his works, Ciceri mixes different media and techniques to achieve richness in the details and what he calls a “flowing esthetic”. For his animations, he often uses automated movements created with generative software or physical motorized gears.
